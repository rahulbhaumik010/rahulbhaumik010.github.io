      <h2>A Framework for Sustainable and AI-Enhanced Design Practices</h2>
      <p>As the demand for digital services grows, so does the energy footprint of web applications and user interfaces. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework for integrating sustainable practices into the UI/UX design process, enhanced by AI-driven tools.</p>

      <h3>Design Strategies for Energy Efficiency</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use of dark themes:</strong> Especially for OLED and AMOLED displays, darker backgrounds significantly reduce energy consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimized media usage:</strong> Limiting high-resolution images and autoplay videos can reduce bandwidth and energy needs.</li>
        <li><strong>System-default fonts:</strong> Relying on built-in fonts eliminates the need for external font loading, saving both time and energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimalist layout and animations:</strong> Reduces processor workload and enhances responsiveness, particularly on older devices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI-Enabled Design Assistance</h3>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence can aid designers by offering real-time feedback and suggestions during the design phase. AI tools can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze design mockups and estimate their energy consumption based on component complexity.</li>
        <li>Recommend alternatives for heavy components (e.g., compressed image versions or static instead of animated elements).</li>
        <li>Suggest accessible and energy-efficient color palettes and font systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>User-End Sustainability Monitoring</h3>
      <p>On the user side, AI bots embedded in browsers or websites can monitor browsing behavior and generate sustainability reports. These can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Energy consumption estimates per session or website visited.</li>
        <li>Suggestions for more eco-friendly alternatives or habits (e.g., using Reader Mode, reducing brightness).</li>
        <li>Personalized dashboards reflecting cumulative impact and energy savings over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This dual-pronged approach—focusing on both the design/development phase and user-side feedback—paves the way for more responsible and environmentally-conscious digital experiences.</p>
